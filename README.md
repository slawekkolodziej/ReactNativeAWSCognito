# React native AWS Cognito module

ReactNative module for authentication with AWS Cognito.

Motivation to work on this module (and so, best use case) was having a secure, simple and cheap user management system that can access AWS IoT devices.

It supports Enhanced (Simplified) Authflow as described on http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html

There are some limitations in this module:
- only iOS is supported
- it supports only AWS Cognito login provider

Pull requests welcome!
